I'm creating a digital marketing content strategy focused on [NICHE].

**How to use these prompts:**
1. Copy a prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
2. Replace [BRACKETED TEXT] with your specific details
3. Ask follow-up questions like "Can you make this more urgent?" or "Give me 5 variations"
4. Use outputs as starting points (don't use verbatim—add your personality)

**Pro tip:** Combine multiple prompts. Use the pillar generator first, then use angles for each pillar.

**Note:** These prompts work best with AI models trained on marketing data (ChatGPT 4, Claude 3, Gemini). Older models may produce generic results.
